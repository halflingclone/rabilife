Basically what the name implies...<br>
It looks for covenant and mystic summons no equipment whatsoever(Too much work calculating eficiency and adding images for the expected equipment).<br>
I made it for blue stacks(because of latency) and full screen,1080p.(beacause of resolution)<br>
If anyone wants to comment on anything fell free.<br>
I can't asure you this program will pick up 100% of the summons shown on screen but I'm fairly certain it'll pick most of them.<br>
If you want 100% you should probably do it manualy. <br>
I recommend to anyone new to python to install it with the anaconda distribution and don't forget to isntall the modules.<br>
To do this open the Anaconda Promt and enter the following commands.<br>
pip install pywin32<br>
pip install keyboard<br>
pip install pyautogui<br>
pip install opencv-python<br>

Lastly take your own images pls don't trust mine many problems can be solved doing that once the program is running.
Also I don't mind anyone copying my code or improving it, just please make it public I also want a better way of doing this LOL!<br>
